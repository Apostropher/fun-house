1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
    * Around 6 hours. I'm quite unfamilar wih Laravel so a lot of time was spent understanding its workings. If I had more time & more familiarity with Laravel, I'd do proper TDD and create PHPSpec & Behat scenarios
2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
    * Was there a choice?
3. What is your favourite thing about Laravel?
    * Relatively simple to create data fixtures & commands.
4. What is your least favourite?
    * I don't know yet.
5. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
    * Mysql profile tools would help with this. Particularly the explain command.
